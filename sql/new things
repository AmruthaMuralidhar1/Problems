To check the characters in a string use right(name, 3) = checks the rightmost (last) 3 characters of the string
to check if the city name starts with vowels use 
select CITY from STATION where left(CITY, 1) = 'a' or left(CITY, 1) = 'e' or left(CITY, 1) = 'i' or left(CITY, 1) = 'o' or left(CITY, 1) = 'u';
or 
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE 'A%' OR CITY LIKE 'E%' OR CITY LIKE 'I%' OR CITY LIKE 'O%' OR CITY LIKE 'U%';

this is string ending with vowels
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE '%A' OR CITY LIKE '%E' OR CITY LIKE '%I' OR CITY LIKE '%O' OR CITY LIKE '%U';

both starting and ending with vowels
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(LEFT(CITY, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
AND LOWER(RIGHT(CITY, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

triangles
SELECT CASE
WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
ELSE 'Scalene'
END
